# Pacman
Again, just a basic game, except the AIs choose the direction to go in based on the largest difference in X and Y coordinates between the ghost and pacman, so it's harder
than regular pacman. But, to make it slightly easier whenever they hit walls they randomize where they go, which makes it so that sometimes if they hit a wall they stop chasing you.

Other than that it has pretty basic graphics, I could come back and animate it if I wanted to as well.
